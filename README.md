# Introduction to Julia tutorial at SciPy 2014

David P. Sanders created this tutorial and gave it at the conference
[SciPy2014](https://conference.scipy.org/scipy2014/). Video recordings are 
available: [part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkgEddb4-A) and 
[part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3JH5Bg46yU).

The tutorial consistes of a sequence of IPython Notebooks using the IJulia profile. 
To follow the tutorial you need to have ready [IPython Notebook](Install IPython Notebook.md)
and of course the [Julia language](Install Julia.md) along with some 
[Julia packages](Install Julia Packages.md). Best install them in that order.


## Getting started 
Invoke IJulia (IPython Notebook with Julia profile) by (a window will open in your web browser): 
```Shell
ipython notebook --profile julia
```

Then start the tutorial in IPython Notebook from the [index](Index.ipynb). 

If you do not have IPython Notebook at hand you can view the tutorial online on
[NbViewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/dpsanders/scipy_2014_julia/blob/master/Index.ipynb).

Nota bene: Julia can be started from the command line by typing `julia` or by double clicking
on its icon. `quit()` ends the julia session.
